######(a brief guide)

Hello everyone, and thanks for coming.

I have a question: What does the word “politics” mean to you? Shout it out.

I’m going to be completely honest. I have spent my entire career trying to avoid politics.

I never wanted to get involved in anything that seemed sinister.

Instead, throughout my career, I’ve listened very closely to whoever was on my team, worked hard to solve any problems they had, and made sure they were happy throughout the process.

And recently, someone said to me, “That sounds like politics.”

So here we are.

# A little about me...

???
- I was a print designer for about 10 years, and have spent the last 7 years managing delivery of digital products.

- I have worked at small companies with 3 employees, as well as large organizations with over 100,000 employees.

- And now I’m here at Alpha, where I manage product and design for our enterprise platform. Our platform delivers user research, prototypes and insights that empower Fortune 500 innovation teams in finance, healthcare, pharma and media.

<br>
I’ve had quite a range of experiences.

- Every time I switched positions and started at a new company, I would have to ask myself:
- How do I work with this new group of people, given my new role?

- After doing this over and over again, I realized that, despite different team members, company structures, and changing technologies, three things stayed the same:

## <strong>The 3 Truths</strong>

--

# The only thing you control is yourself

--

# Decisions are made by a select few

--

# You look good when they look good


???
Understanding these truths will set you up for success in your career, as well as in life.

---

## <strong>Truth #1</strong>

# The only thing you control is yourself



???
##Truth #1
#The only thing you can control is yourself

You can control:
- What you do


And you can control:
- What you say


## You **cannot** control other people's minds, behaviors or expectations:
- They have a right to believe what they want to believe
- They have their own sets of motivations that have nothing to do with you
- And they will never fully think the way you do, because they are not you.


I suggest you use what you can control to become part of the solution, and not part of the problem.

---

## <strong>Truth #1</strong>
# The only thing you control is yourself

- ### &#187; Meet as many people as possible



???
# Meet as many people as possible

- Some of your colleagues may only speak to executives. I encourage you to meet everyone, including interns, assistants, and people from departments unlike yours.

- Learn about their lives: find out who they care about, and what they value. Get to know them as human beings, and not just their titles.

- People will judge you based on how you make them feel. Make everyone feel important.

- You may have to work with people that you don't like, or who don't like you.
- If you don't like them, ask yourself, "Why?" Are you biased against them for some reason? Try to look past it.
- If they don't like you, be respectful towards them, but let it go.

- Meet enough people, and you will make allies at all levels, in many different areas.

<br>
##This is how I got into the creative field.
- I was working as a sales assistant for a magazine, but I wanted to learn more about design.

- So, I became friendly with the design intern.

- When there was an opening in the design department, he got me an interview, and I got the job.

---

## <strong>Truth #1</strong>
# The only thing you control is yourself

- ### &#187; Meet as many people as possible
- ### &#187; Learn how to listen



???

## Learn how to listen
- When someone chooses to speak to you, pay attention. What are they complaining about? Or what is making them happy?

- If they are coming to you for help, note their body language and tone. Are they frustrated? Tired? Scared? What is not said can be more important than what is said.

- Treat their perspective with respect—every person deserves to be heard.

- When people think you aren’t listening to them, they might yell at you. Bring down the anger (and volume) by echoing what you have heard, and offering solutions or support.

- Try not to engage in negative gossip, especially with people you don’t know well.

<br>
## I worked with this account manager once.
- When she was new, she was very friendly to me. But every day she would come into my office, and say extremely negative things about other people. One woman down the hall had terrible B.O., another woman was being such a bitch.

- I would nod, and say something like, oh, that’s too bad, but I would never contribute. It felt like she was trying to get me to agree with her and make other negative remarks.

- Soon after that, she stopped coming by, and started to slam me behind my back.

## <strong>Truth #1</strong>
# The only thing you control is yourself

- ### &#187; Meet as many people as possible
- ### &#187; Learn how to listen
- ### &#187; Build your credibility


???

## Build your credibility

- In order to make progress in your company, you must build and maintain credibility within your team.

##You build credibility by:
- Delivering what is asked of you, and then some

## Listen closely to those around you. Instead of just giving them what they’ve asked for, think through the request. What is their real end goal? What can you provide, so that they reach it?

- Pay attention to positive and negative feedback in your work. Look for patterns. You'll notice that certain things come easy to you, while others do not. Make sure that you are actively improving yourself based on the negative feedback.

- Helping others achieve a) their personal goals and b) their business goals

- Anticipate unsaid needs based on what is asked of you, and deliver based on that.

If you don’t deliver what is expected of you, you will lose trust.
- And it is not easy to get that back.
- People will be watching you and waiting for you to make more mistakes, and you may miss out on future opportunities to prove yourself.


<br>
A friend of mine is a Senior Design Manager at a major consumer goods company.
- One designer on her team is consistently unprepared for design reviews, and the rest of his team no longer trusts him to do his job.

- She expects him to stay a junior designer, because he hasn’t demonstrated any initiative to improve or grow, despite consistent negative feedback.

<br>
Remember: If you’re not part of the solution, you will be perceived as part of the problem.

## <strong>Truth #1</strong>
# The only thing you control is yourself

- ### &#187; Meet as many people as possible
- ### &#187; Learn how to listen
- ### &#187; Build your credibility
- ### &#187; Avoid saying “I don’t know”


???

<br>
## Avoid saying “I don’t know” at all costs

The person who asked you will be thinking:
- Why don’t you know?
- Isn’t that your job?
- Why are we paying you?
- And a bunch of other negative questions.

Instead, just answer:
- “I’ll let you know shortly” or
- “Let me find out”

This buys you time. Use it. Come up with multiple answers and options, so you are seen as helpful and not a blocker.

- ### &#187; Learn how to listen
- ### &#187; Build your credibility
- ### &#187; Avoid saying “I don’t know”
- ### &#187; Make the most out of every task


???

<br>
## Make the most out of every task
- It’s easy when you’re creating work that aligns with your goals. But when your team asks you to do stuff you don’t want to do, you might resent them for it. Think about these options instead:

Do it fast.
- Take this opportunity to speed up and automate your workflow. Set up templates, organize your files, learn all the shortcuts. This way, you can knock that stuff out and transfer these skills to other projects.

Find another resource.
- Give it to someone else, instruct that person how to do it, and supervise their work. You’ll build leadership and teaching skills in the process.

Force yourself to use a new tool.
- It might take you longer to deliver, but you’ll have a new tool on your resume.
- It takes practice, but you can learn something new from even the most mundane tasks.

If your goal in the company is:
- to create a product that is “brought to life”
- Remember that it doesn’t stand a chance without the buy in of this group

First:
Get to know your key decision makers

If you’re at a large company:
- Take any opportunity you can to introduce yourself, whether you’re at the same meeting, at an office party, or facing each other in the hallway

- A little face recognition goes a long way, especially within a large organization.

- Become friendly with their assistants and other people they work with. You can ask these people for a quick introduction as well. Plus, assistants are great because they can get you on the calendar for future meetings.

- Make sure they know your name, what you do, and what your contributions have been to date.

- Get to know them. Chances are, they’ll tell you about their spouse and their kids. Keep mental notes and ask about their families from time to time.

- Build on this relationship with light conversation, and say hi whenever you can.

- You are creating the Mere-exposure effect, so that leadership develops a preference for you based on familiarity.

- This helps you establish your future credibility as a known resource.

- Now, if you work in a startup or a small company, you have direct access to your senior leaders. Get to know what they like. What is important to them? What do they hate?

# Do a SWOT Analysis on the business

## Strengths
## Weaknesses
## Opportunities
## Threats

- Identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.
- Current and future competitors.
- And metrics to improve within your organization.


Leadership is having a very hard time knowing what to build next.

- Any change in a product they make could cause a loss in revenue, and that is a very stressful position to be in.

- Do your homework up front, and learn what the opportunities and risks to the business are, so that your solutions are as well-informed as possible.

- This research will position you for additional credibility, because it will show that you’re interested in the future success of the company.


Expect opposition and reversals of approval

- It always happens with this group. I can’t tell you how many times:

- I worked on projects that went through multiple rounds of changes and approvals with product, marketing and brand, only to have it killed by senior leadership or legal right before it was about to ship.

- I have been on calls where two successful brands who created a partnership product could not agree on logo placement and size.

- Senior leadership has the right to pull the plug on anything. Accept it. Position yourself as a supportive, reliable partner, and have plans B - Z in your back pocket.

---

## <strong>Truth #3</strong>
# You look good when they look good


???
## If you make their job easier, you will look good

- Pull this off, and you become the person that everyone wants to work with.
- You’ll need to treat each stakeholder group a little differently.

Here’s a quick guide:

---

# Senior Leadership


???
# Senior Leadership
- They are responsible for the company’s success or failure, which is tied to:
- Increasing revenue (getting new clients)
- Decreasing costs (reduce development and design time)

Always make decisions and recommendations based on these goals
- I once managed a site redesign that was sold to the client at a very low budget.

- After reviewing the scope of the project, I immediately raised concerns with the CEO (who wrote the scope) that the budget was too low. He disagreed and said it was my job to make sure we stayed within budget.

- Despite my best efforts to keep our hours down, constant changes from our client drove the hours back up. I started writing emails politely stating that we would do our best to accommodate the changes, but that they were out of scope.

- I collected the client emails, shared them with the CEO, and drafted change orders to cover the new costs. The CEO tried to negotiate for the full amount, but our client would only agree to a small percentage.

- While the CEO was extremely unhappy that we had to eat most of the cost, he admitted (after everything) that in fact, he had underestimated the budget. From then on, I was asked for my input on all estimates before sharing with the client.

---
# Senior Leadership
# Product Managers



???
# Product Managers
- It depends on what type of PM you have. I’ve heard stories of sharp PMs as well as anecdotes about lousy PMs who have no idea how to do it.

- Most people “stumble” into this position from a variety of backgrounds: business, engineering, marketing, or data (note: very rarely, design).

- Since they are all so different, I interviewed 5 PMs on what they want from designers:

Ask a lot of questions up front
- What user and business problems is the PM trying to solve?
- What data does the PM have that will inform the solution?
- What data should be gathered to support the solution?

Be a team player
- Show multiple ways to visually solve the problem.
- Use your design skills to create what they cannot.
- Be receptive to feedback, but also push back and defend your work
- Back up design decisions with additional user research (surveys, remote interviews, hallway tests)

Demonstrate that you understand and empathize with their position
- I was working on the redesign of a high-profile ecommerce site. Our target launch date was right before Black Friday, but at the last minute, we received a flurry of changes from senior leadership.

- I was concerned that these new changes would jeopardize our launch date, because of the time needed for proper testing.

- I brought this up to the product manager, and he sounded scared. He said that was not an option—if we did not launch in time for Black Friday, his company would lose thousands in revenue.

- I realized that he was under tremendous pressure from his senior leadership. I assured him we would get it done, and outlined several contingency plans for testing before launch.

# Senior Leadership
# Product Managers
# Developers



???
# Developers
- Understand their constraints

- They often inherit legacy systems, older architecture, or technical debt

- Any change they make to the code base adds complexity, increases bugs and results in a less stable platform.

- Some requests are easy to execute; others will be impossible based on time or budget.

Simplify your requests and save them time
- Reduce unnecessary complexity as much as possible, for less risk

- Ask yourself: do you really need that feature, or is there a simpler way to execute?

- Leverage UI patterns that already exist, so there is less customization

- Instead of changing visual elements to improve usability, consider editing the content.

- At Alpha, we release features on a daily basis. Often, a developer will write the content needed in order to ship the feature. I usually tweak the language that is shipped to make the feature useable for humans (without redesigning anything).

Overcommunicate
- Provide visuals and prototypes so they aren’t guessing at what you want
- Make sure they understand your requirements, questions and suggestions
- Be sure that you really need what you ask for
- Never ask for a feature without finding out the level of complexity first

---

# Everyone else
- ### Client / Customer Success
- ### Business Development / Sales
- ### Research
- ### Design
- ### Content / Marketing



???
- Does anyone know why I put these groups last?
- You should absolutely talk to people in each of these groups and get their feedback, as well as learn what their goals are.
- It's important to note that each group has different priorities, and if you are a designer, it's up to you to consider everyone's needs.

- Just be aware: the key decision makers are not often in these groups.
- Making decisions based on one group of people will not serve you in the long run.

- For more tangible information on how to manage stakeholder types, I recommend this great book called Articulating Design Decisions by Tom Greever. If you take anything away from this talk, buy this book.

- Just ask them—what would make their jobs easier? With Client Managers and Sales, they are the ones speaking with customers all the time, and will be your best source for learning about the perceptions of the products you work on.

As a designer, you are already considered a valued member of the team.

# In closing...



???

- A lot of this sounds like common sense.
- But it takes effort and awareness to do these things every day.
- It will evolve and change with every person you work with.
- And some days, it won't be easy.

<br>
- But I realized a long time ago that when I put in the effort, magical things happen.
- Teams rally for support. Trust and goodwill is built. And work gets easier and more fun.

<br>
- We spend so much time at work.
- We see our coworkers more than our friends and significant others.
- We owe it to ourselves to try and have a good time, and not have it suck.
